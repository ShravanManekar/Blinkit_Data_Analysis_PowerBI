# Blinkit_Data_Analysis_PowerBI
My first Data Analysis project using Power BI (Blinkit Case Study).
# 📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

## 🔹 Project Overview  
This project is my **first end-to-end Data Analysis case study** using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to explore Blinkit’s sales dataset and design an **interactive dashboard** that helps uncover:  
- How different outlet types and sizes perform  
- Which product categories drive the most sales  
- The role of fat content in revenue contribution  
- Long-term sales growth trends  

Through this project, I built hands-on skills in:  
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Creating a **date/calendar table** for proper time intelligence  
- Writing **DAX measures** (MTD, QTD, YTD, Previous Year, YoY Growth %)  
- Designing **KPI-driven, interactive dashboards** for decision-making
